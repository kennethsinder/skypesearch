# SkypeSearch

Command-line script to search for a particular string in group conversations created by Skype (in local sqlite3 db).
Skype for Linux does not support group chats, so for now this only works on Windows.

Currently WIP.

## How to Install

1. Install sqlite3 for Windows from the official website.

2. TBD
