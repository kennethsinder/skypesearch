# SkypeSearch

Command-line script to search for a particular string in group conversations created by Skype (in local sqlite3 db).
Skype for Linux does not support group chats, so for now this only works on Windows.

Currently WIP.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.

2. `cd` into the directory you downloaded and extracted SkypeSearch into.

3. From a Windows command prompt, cdrun `python search.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Enjoy searching for old Skype messages you thought everyone forgot about! :)
